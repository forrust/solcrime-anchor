# Building Solana Accounts for Solcrime.io
This section outlines the design and development requirements for implementing Solana blockchain functionality in Solcrime.io, focusing on custom SPL tokens, player profiles, assets, and the management programs necessary for game operation.

## Custom SPL Token ($SOLR)
**Status:** To be determined

**Objective:** Create a custom SPL token ($SOLR) to serve as the in-game currency. This token will be used for transactions, purchasing in-game items, and other economic activities within the game.

**Development Needs:**
- Design the tokenomics including supply, distribution, and minting process.
- Implement smart contracts for $SOLR using the Solana blockchain.
- Ensure integration with player accounts for seamless transaction processes.

## Player Profile (NFT)
**Status:** To be determined

**Objective:** Each player profile will be represented as an NFT, which holds the player's achievements, rank, and owned assets.

**Development Needs:**
- Define the metadata structure for the NFT, including player stats, achievements, and ownership records.
- Develop smart contracts for minting and managing player profile NFTs.
- Integrate NFTs with the game's UI for displaying player profiles and achievements.

## Assets (NFT)
**Status:** To be determined

**Objective:** In-game assets such as gear, properties, and special items will be minted as NFTs, allowing players to own, trade, or sell these assets within the game ecosystem.

**Development Needs:**
- Specify the types of assets available and their characteristics.
- Develop smart contracts for asset NFTs, including minting, transferring, and burning mechanisms.
- Create a marketplace or trading system for players to interact with these assets.

## Programs
**Objective:** Develop Solana programs (smart contracts) to manage game functionality, including player actions, economic transactions, and game logic.

### Player Management
- Handle player registration, progression, and profile updates.
- Manage NFT minting for new player profiles.

### Token Management
- Oversee the issuance, transfer, and burning of $SOLR tokens.
- Integrate with Solana's SPL Token program for seamless currency management.

### Inventory Management
- Track player ownership of items and assets.
- Facilitate the trade or sale of items between players.

### Crime/Job/Mission Management
- Implement game mechanics for players to engage in crimes, jobs, or missions.
- Ensure rewards and consequences are accurately processed.

### Combat/Health Management
- Manage player health stats and combat mechanics.
- Determine outcomes of player vs. environment (PvE) or player vs. player (PvP) encounters.

## Data Accounts
**Objective:** Utilize Solana's data accounts to store game-related data securely and efficiently.

### Players
- Store player profiles, stats, and progression.

### Items
- Keep a record of all in-game items, their ownership, and status.

### Transactions
- Log all game-related transactions, including token transfers and item trades.

### Gamestates
