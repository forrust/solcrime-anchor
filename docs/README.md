[Solcrime.io](https://solcrime.io) is a text-based mafia-style game set in a modern-themed world. The concept involves creating an SPL token called $SOLR (Sollars), which will serve as the in-game currency for purchasing gear, properties, and assets, all of which are minted as NFTs. Players start the game by ranking their characters through playing street crimes, which generates (mints) small amounts of $SOLR. By advancing through these crimes and earning Sollars, players can rank up through a progression system that ranges from thug to godfather or similar ranks.

There are two main differences compared to a typical mafia-style game. The first difference is that this game generates Solana Tokens ($SOLR) that hold real value. Secondly, the universe of this game is set in a post-apocalyptic world where AI has begun to dominate humanity. As a result, there are factions of resistance mobs that earn Sollars and accumulate wealth through properties such as:
 - Cars (which can be used for jobs)
 - Housing (which provides shelter) 
 - Gear (for offensive and defensive bonusses)
 - Factories (which can be used for manufacturing goods like gear)

On a personal note, I have experience building and supporting web applications using JavaScript, PHP, MariaDB, Python, Devops. However, I have yet to learn Rust and the Anchor framework, and even more so the underlying architecture of how to use accounts properly, which I somewhat underestimated. This has resulted in my inability to deliver a working development network. Despite this, I am committed to continuing this project. I decided to submit it anyway because I am fond of this idea and wish to move forward, although I acknowledge that I will need time and additional knowledge. My priority is to ensure that I do not introduce any bugs or errors that could potentially lead to users losing money due to my oversight. Any help is welcome, especially as it comes to blockchain design on Solana.

### Why i'm Building This Product
The motivation behind Solcrime.io stems from a desire to blend the classic allure of text-based mafia games with the potential of blockchain technology. My aim is to provide a gaming experience where actions within the game have real-world economic implications, thanks to the integration of Solana Tokens ($SOLR) and NFTs. This project is not just a game; it's an experiment in creating a self-sustaining digital economy, a playground for strategic minds, and a community for those fascinated by the intersection of gaming and cryptocurrency.

### Product's Target Audience / Market
Solcrime.io is geared towards a diverse audience, including:
- Classic text-based game enthusiasts looking for a modern twist.
- Cryptocurrency users and blockchain enthusiasts interested in novel ways to engage with digital assets.
- Strategic game players who enjoy building, strategizing, and competing in an economically driven game world.
- Fans of mafia-style narratives and post-apocalyptic settings, offering a rich, immersive backstory.

### Long Term Vision
The long-term vision for Solcrime.io is to establish a fully decentralized, player-driven game economy that mirrors real-world economic principles. I envision a platform where players not only engage in a game but also contribute to a living ecosystem where every action impacts the economy. Future expansions include introducing decentralized digital assets.

### Demo Concept
[Solcrime.io](https://solcrime.io) has a demo online of the basic working and street crimes as a start, later we will add functionalities like ranking, missions, hacks, attacks, hitlist, etc

### Background
I am a passionate web developer with experience in creating and managing dynamic web applications. My journey into blockchain gaming is driven by a combination of nostalgia and innovation. Inspired by mafia-style games from my youth and recognizing the potential of blockchain technology to redefine gaming economies, i started developing Solcrime.io. Despite facing the steep learning curve of Rust and the Anchor framework, my determination to bring my vision to life. 

### Conclusion
As a developer stepping into blockchain gaming is quite overwhelming and my project is ambitious and challenging, but stems from a passion for webdevelopment, gaming and blockchain tech.. Specifically Solana.
